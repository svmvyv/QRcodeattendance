# Attendify : Automated Attendance System.
## _Marking attendance made easier._


An automated attendance system which records the student’s attendance. The system creates a unique QR code that pertains to the specific class, day, and time. 
When the student scans this specific QR code, attendance will automatically be marked to the student’s ID. 
To ensure they are present and confirm attendance in the classroom, their location is verified through the application by Bluetooth beacons.

Objectives:
- To create a software for students and instructors to take attendance.
- To exploit and integrate available technologies (e.g., QR and indoor positioning services) that is cost-efficient.
- To organize the process in which attendance is taken.
- To reduce paperwork and administrative data entry work.
